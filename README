This is a captive portal written in python that leverages linux iptables.

The iptables configuration required must be loaded using the command "iptables-restore < iptables.v4"

Python Version: 2.7
Requirements: flask, python-iptables

**As of right now the captive portal only supports intercepting http requests
**The plan is to add https support soon
